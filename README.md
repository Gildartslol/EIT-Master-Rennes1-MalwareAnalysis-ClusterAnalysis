# Malware Analysis
## Cluster analysis

Historically, malware protection has heavily relied on manual reverse engineer
for analyzing and creating signature creation against suspicious programs.
However, with the advent of techniques such as polymorphism/metamorphism,
malware started to grow exponentially in number and quickly evolve in com-
plexity, making the manual approach infeasible. In this scenario, it is im-
perative to rely on techniques that can autonomously analyze and help to
better respond to cyberthreats. Towards this goal, in this project we are go-
ing to practice the cluster analysis for malware classi cation, i.e., assigning
the correct malware type and family/strain to malicious samples.

## Summary
The project includes features (e.g. strings,  le type, etc.) extracted from
di erent binaries. The goal is to to compute clustering based on these features
by resorting to unsupervised learning algorithms.
The dataset is serialized in pickle format (see here how to read this  le)
and saved in the  le dataset.pkl at the root of the project's repository (access
here for the invitation).
In this project it is important to follow the work
ow for cluster analysis,
i.e.:

- 1. Data gathering
- 2. Data processing
- 3. Feature engineering
- 4. Algorithm selection
- 5. Cluster analysis

Recall that de ning the relevant features to be used in a cluster analysis
is key factor for its success. Therefore, you can complete the original dataset
with external data (i.e. data gathering), modify/clean up data (i.e. data
processing) and encode data (i.e. feature engineering) as you deem necessary.
Comparing di erent algorithms, specially when their working principles
di er, is strongly suggested. In the report, explain the overall concepts of the
1
chosen algorithms and provide details on how to compare them. As long as
necessary, repeat the work
ow so as to re ne your results. Finally, select the
best clustering results that are able to unveil the malware families present in
the dataset.
